# coding workflow preferences

- focus on the areas of code relavant to the task
- do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- write thorough tests for all major functionality
- avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed 
- always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
